### Flags

The flags is divided into three groups base on function:

* Status flags
* Control flags
* System flags

#### Status flags

|Flag|  Bit|  Name |
|:----:|:-----:|:------:|
|CF|  0|  Carry flag |
|PF|  2|  Parity flag |
|AF|  4|  Adjust flag |
|ZF|  6|  Zero flag |
|SF|  7|  Sign flag |
|OF|  11|  Overflow flag |

###  three different methods of accessing system memory

* Flat memory model: The flat memory model presents all system memory as a contiguous address space. All instructions,
data, and the stack are contained in the same address space. Each memory location is accessed by a spe-
cific address, called a linear address.

* Segmented memory model: The segmented memory model divides the system memory into groups of independent segments, refer-
enced by pointers located in the segment registers. Each segment is used to contain a specific type of
data. One segment is used to contain instruction codes, another data elements, and a third the program
stack.

* Real-address mode: Memory locations in segments are defined by logical addresses. A logical address consists of a segment
address and an offset address. The processor translates a logical address to a corresponding linear
address location to access the byte of memory.


### .string vs .ascii vs .asciz

* .ascii "string"...

.ascii expects zero or more string literals separated by commas. It assembles each string (with no automatic trailing zero byte) into consecutive addresses.

* .asciz "string"...

.asciz is just like .ascii, but each string is followed by a zero byte. The "z" in `.asciz' stands for "zero".

* .string "str"

Copy the characters in str to the object file. You may specify more than one string to copy, separated by commas.
Unless otherwise specified for a pafffrticular machine, the assembler marks the end of each string with a 0 byte.
You can use any of the escape sequences described in section Strings.

### Instruction names

Instruction names usually end in either "l", "w", or "b", indicating the size of the operands: long (32 bits), word (16 bits), or byte (8 bits),
respectively. For our purposes, we will usually be using the "l" (long) suffix. [See more](http://www.hep.wisc.edu/~pinghc/x86AssmTutorial.htm)
```
b = byte (8 bit)
s = short (16 bit integer) or single (32-bit floating point)
w = word (16 bit)
l = long (32 bit integer or 64-bit floating point)
q = quad (64 bit)
t = ten bytes (80-bit floating point)
```

### CMP & EFLAFGS

The CMP Instruction:

The CMP instruction operates by performing an implied subtraction of the two operands. This means that the result is not stored in memory. After subtracting them, it does a few quick tests, updating the Z,O,C,S, and P flags. The P, or parity, flag is rarely used, so we&#39;ll ignore it in this article for the purpose of brevity.

Binary subtraction is performed by adding the negated version of the second operand from the first. This is just like what you learned in middle school, about how 4+3 = 4 - (-3), and visa versa.
At the end of the article I will explain how this is done, but I&#39;ll move onto the more important matters for now since that knowledge is not really needed for cracking or coding.

Sign and Zero Flag:

The four flags that the CMP instruction can set - Z,O,C, and S, are known as the zero, overflow, carry, and sign flags respectively. The zero flag is set whenever the result of the subtraction is equal to zero. This, of course, only occurs when the operands are equal. The sign flag is set when the result of the subtraction is negative. Although we are inclined to think that this means the sign flag in combination with the zero flag are enough to test all &gt; &gt;= &lt; and &lt;=, this is not true, because the result can be negative even if the first number is greater than the second. This is because of overflow.

Overflow Flag:

Signed integers are represented in binary with the same amount of bits as unsigned integers. This means, of course, that the sign must be set in one of the bits of the integer. Signed integers store the sign in the MSB (most significant bit). This means that, while 00000001 converts to 1 in decimal, 10000001 converts to -127. I will discuss why it is -127 and not -1 or -2 later in the article.
When the processor performs subtraction, It wraps around if the subtraction goes below 00000000 or above 11111111. Therefore, if you subtract a negative number from a positive one, or subtract a positive number from a negative one, there is the possibility that the answer will overflow over the boundary. For example, 100 - (-100) is equal to 200, but the highest value an 8 bit signed integer can be is 127, so 200 will wrap through the upper boundary and end up as a negative number, even though it should be positive. The same problem occurs with -100 - 100; It wraps through the low end and ends up positive when it should be negative, causing an underflow. Note that an underflow also sets the overflow flag, and overflow will refer to both overflows and underflows further in the article. The CPU checks for this, and sets the overflow flag if it occurs.

Carry Flag:

The carry flag is set when, if both operands are interpreted as unsigned integers, the first one is greater. This is easy to determine because it occurs whenever the subtraction passes through 00000000 into the higher range (11111111).
For example, 00000001 - 00000010 = 11111111, so carry is set. However, 00000010 - 00000001 = 00000001, so carry is not set.

### POPing and PUSHing all the register

|Instruction|  Description |
|:----------|:-------------|
|PUSHA/POPA|  Push or pop all of the 16-bit general-purpose registers |
|PUSHAD/POPAD|  Push or pop all of the 32-bit general-purpose registers |
|PUSHF/POPF|  Push or pop the lower 16 bits of the EFLAGS register |
|PUSHFD/POPFD|  Push or pop the entire 32 bits of the EFLAGS register |

The PUSHA instruction pushes the 16-bit registers so they appear
on the stack in the following order: DI, SI, BP, BX, DX, CX, and finally, AX. The PUSHAD instruction pushes
the 32-bit counterparts of these registers in the same order. The POPA and POPAD instructions retrieve the
registers in the reverse order they were pushed.

### Intel suggests the rules when defining data

* Align 16-bit data on a 16-byte boundary. 
* Align 32-bit data so that its base address is a multiple of four. 
* Align 64-bit data so that its base address is a multiple of eight. 
* Avoid many small data transfers. Instead, use a single large data transfer. 
* Avoid using larger data sizes (such as 80- and 128-bit floating-point values) in the stack. 

 If you have a lot of similarly sized data elements, such as
integer and floating-point values, place them together at the beginning of the data section. This ensures
that they will maintain the proper alignment. If you have a lot of odd-sized data elements, such as
strings and buffers, place those at the end of the data section so they won’t throw off the alignment of
the other data elements.

The gas assembler supports the .align directive, which is used to align defined data elements on spe-
cific memory boundaries. The .align directive is placed immediately before the data definition in the
data section, instructing the assembler to position the data element on a memory boundary.

### Stack in function
```
function_label:
	pushl %ebp
	movl %esp, %ebp
	< normal function code goes here>
	movl %ebp, %esp
	popl %ebp
	ret
```
Once the EBP register has been saved, it can be used as the base pointer to the stack for all access to the
stack within the function. Before returning to the calling program, the ESP register must be restored to
the location pointing to the calling memory location.

### Conditional jump instruction

|:----------|:------------|:------------|
|JA| 	Jump if above| 	CF=0 and ZF=0 |
|JAE| 	Jump if above or equal| 	CF=0 |

|JPO| 	Jump if parity odd| 	PF=0 |
|JS| 	Jump if sign| 	SF=1 |
|JZ| 	Jump if zero| 	ZF=1 |

### When to set carry flag

* The carry flag is used in mathematical expressions to indicate when an overflow has occurred in an
unsigned number (remember that signed numbers use the overflow flag). The carry flag is set when an
instruction causes a register to go beyond its data size limit.

* The carry flag will also be set when an unsigned value is less than zero.

|Instruction| 	Description |
|:----------|:--------------|
|CLC| 	Clear the carry flag (set it to zero) |
|CMC| 	Complement the carry flag (change it to the opposite of what is set) |
|STC| 	Set the carry flag (set it to one) |


### The loop instruction

The loop instructions use the ECX register as a counter and automatically decrease its value as the loop
instruction is executed.

|Instruction| 	Description |
|:---------|:---------------|
|LOOP|			Loop until the ECX register is zero |
|LOOPE/LOOPZ| 		Loop until either the ECX register is zero, or the ZF flag is not set |
|LOOPNE/LOOPNZ| 	Loop until either the ECX register is zero, or the ZF flag is set |

Before the loop starts, you must set the value for the number of iterations to perform in the ECX register.
This usually looks something like the following:
```
	< code before the loop >
	movl $100, %ecx
loop1:
	< code to loop through >
	loop loop1
	< code after the loop >
```
An added benefit of the loop instructions is that they decrease the value of the ECX register without
affecting the EFLAGS register flag bits. When the ECX register reaches zero, the Zero flag is not set.

If the value of ECX is already zero before the
LOOP instruction, it will be decreased by one, making it -1. Because this value is not zero, the LOOP
instruction continues on its way, looping back to the defined label. The loop will eventually exit when
the register overflows, and the incorrect value is displayed.

### Hight-Level Conditional Branches and Assembly Branches

The assembly language code used to implement an if statement looks like the following:
```
if:
	<condition to evaluate>
	jxx else
	 ; jump to the else part if the condition is false
	 <code to implement the “then” statements>
	 jmp end
	  ;jump to the end
else:
	< code to implement the “else” statements>
end:
```

`if(eax < ebx) || (eax == ecx) then ` creates the following assembly language code:
```
if:
	cmpl %eax, %ebx
	jle else
	cmpl %eax, %ecx
	jne else
then:
	< then logic code>
	jmp end
else:
	< else logic code >
end:
```

The framework for implementing for loops in assembly language. The
pseudocode looks something like this:
```
for:
	<condition to evaluate for loop counter value>
	jxx forcode
	; jump to the code of the condition is true
	jmp end
	; jump to the end if the condition is false
forcode:
	< for loop code to execute>
	<increment for loop counter>
	jmp for	   ; Go back to the start of the for-statement
end:
```
